## Sathwik Bakery Application

Enjoy the demo of my website, have a look at it and enjoy the animations [Sathwik Bakery](https://sathwik-bakery-1lwmcbuo8-sanjujamma-gmailcom.vercel.app/?vercelToolbarCode=d2-qf_DqL4K4lNP)

To run it locally, first clone and then go into folder and in terminal, make sure yarn is already installed in your system.

```
yarn && yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Tools I used: `Next.JS 13`, `Typescript`, `Zustand` for state management, `Framer Motion` etc.. for the animations.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
