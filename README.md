## Sathwik Bakery Application

Demo of my website, once kindly have a look at it [Sathwik Bakery](https://sathwik-bakery-1lwmcbuo8-sanjujamma-gmailcom.vercel.app/?vercelToolbarCode=d2-qf_DqL4K4lNP)

To run it locally, first clone and then go into folder and in terminal, make sure yarn is already installed in your system.

```
yarn && yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Tools I used: `Next.JS 13`, `Typescript`, `Zustand` for state management, `Framer Motion` etc.. for the animations.


### As given in assignment

* Created home page and cart page.
* I have added some transformations while hovering into the products. 
* By clicking on add to cart, you can see the increment in cart and the quantities inside cart page as well
* By reducing the quantity of item to 0 will remove the item from cart.
* Handled back button as well, in home page if you click on back button it won't take to cart page even if it is in history of routing
* You can check the quality of the code I have written in this github repo.
